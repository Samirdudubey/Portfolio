            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p style="font-size: large; font-weight: bold;">
                I'm Sameer Dubey, a computer science student with a strong passion for technology and problem-solving. I'm
                currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Shri Ram Institute of Science and Technology.
                Since the beginning of my academic journey, I've been fascinated by programming languages and their ability
                to bring ideas to life through code. Over the years, I've developed my skills in various aspects while
                studying computer science, including web development, software engineering, and algorithm design.
